# Introduction

Support for a wide range of e-book formats, custom fonts and styling, profiles, extensive gesture support, highlight export, progress sync, a file browser, an SSH server. This is just a fraction of what [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) has to offer. And you don't need the newest ebook reader to run KOReader either. The application is so lightweight and fast that it can invigorate even the most lethargic ereader you'd have otherwise considered replacing. Discovering KOReader's hidden treasures and figuring out how to get the most out of this application can be quite an adventure. An adventure that you can start by picking through my own discoveries that I document here.

!!! info "Hardware and software"
    KOReader's functionality is device-specific. I use the following setup to document the application's features:

    - Kobo Libra 2 with the latest stable version of KOReader
    - Kobo Glo HD with the latest development version of KOReader
    - Linux Mint 21 with the latest version of Calibre
